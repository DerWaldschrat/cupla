**cupla** - C(++) User interface for the Platform independent Library Alpaka
=================================================================

Cupla is a simple user interface for the platform independent library
Alpaka. It follows a similar concept as the Nvidia CUDA (TM) API by
providing a software layer to manage accelerator devices.
Alpaka is used as backend for cupla.

Please keep in mind that the first port from CUDA to cupla(x86) is very slow.
To get a better performance on a x86 systems you need to add the alpaka element
level to your kernels.
